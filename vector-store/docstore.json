This  reader  aims  at  helping  the  child  to  read  for\nmeaning,  and  to  learn  to  communicate  in  English  with  confidence  and\naccuracy.\nCare has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process\nof  teaching  and  learning.  Learner-friendly  language  has  been  used  in\nthe  instructions,  and  the  exercises  and  activities  are  addressed  to  the\nchild.  In  this  process  the  teacher  is  a  facilitator  or  a  co-learner.\nA rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,\ncultural  and  sociological  dimensions  of  texts.  The  themes  range  from\nchildhood  and  adolescence,  to  disability,  talent  and  achievement,  to\nmusic,  science,  and  contemporary  social  and  environmental  concerns.\nThe  range  is  as  inclusive  as  possible,  keeping  in  view  the  interest  and\ncognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres\nsuch  as  story,  biography  and  autobiography;  science  fiction;  humour;\ntravelogue;  and  the  one-act  play.\nThe  number  of  poems  has  been  increased  to  help  learners  explore  this\ngreat  source  of  language,  derive  the  joy  of  learning  through  poetry,  and\nunderstand  the  music  of  words.

THE FUN THEY HAD\nThis story takes us to the world of the future where computers will play\na  major  role.  Let  the  children  talk  freely  about  how  they  imagine  the\nschools of the future that their own children might go to. You might want\nto  explain  the  ideas  of  ‘virtual  reality’  and  ‘virtual  classroom’.  The  term\n‘virtual  reality’  refers  to  a  reality  created  by  computer  software,  and  a\n‘virtual  classroom’  is  not  a  real  classroom  but  one  where  learning  is\nthrough computer software or the Internet. The children may know what\na robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be.\nIn this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate.\nThe  following  points  could  be  explained  before  the  task.\n•A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers\nto  show  skill  and  ability  in  arguing.\n•A  proposition,  a  question  or  a  problem  is  required  for  this  purpose,\nwhich  can  be  spoken  for  or  against.\n•To  participate  in  a  debate,  one  must  prepare  for  it.    So,  one  must\nprepare  an  outline  of  the  main  points  in  the  order  in  which  one  is\ngoing  to  argue.\n•The time limit is about four to five minutes.\n•The  speaker  addresses  the  audience.\n•Every  topic/subject  has  its  own  vocabulary.    These  must  be  learnt.\n•The  speaker  addresses  the  chair  (Mr  President/Madam),  ‘submits’\nan  argument,  ‘appeals’  for  sympathetic  understanding  and  support,\n‘questions’  the  opponent’s  views,  and  ‘concludes’  an  argument.\n2. THE SOUND OF MUSIC\nThese  biographical  pieces  tell  us  of  people  who  have  achieved  success\nand  recognition  through  determination,  hard  work  and  courage.  The\nchildren  may  be  asked  to  think  of  potential  barriers  to  success,  and  of\npeople  who  have  overcome  them.  The  second  part  of  the  unit  encourages",

It  can  be  made  an  authentic  activity  if\nstudents  are  given  a  couple  of  minutes  during  the  morning  assembly  to\nspeak  to  their  fellow-pupils  about  such  a  person.  This  would  give  them\npractice in facing an audience, and encourage them to prepare seriously,\nby:  (i)    noting  down  the  important  points  about  the  person  to  be\nintroduced,  (ii)  using  appropriate  phrases  to  introduce  the  person\n(students  should  be  allowed  to  think  what  phrases  they  want  to  use).\nThe Writing Task is an exercise in comparison.
