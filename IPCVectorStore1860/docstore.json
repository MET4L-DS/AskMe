SECTION BOX - On top of every bare act is a \nsection box. Clicking on this will take you to the \nexact section on that page instantly. There will be no \nloading or delay. (not in PDF)\n\n2. COLOURS - Different colours have been used for \nExplanations, Exceptions, Case Names, Illustrations \netc.\n\n3. PERFECT FOR MOBILE - The font type and font \nsize is suitable for mobile. You will not have to zoom \nto read on a 5 inch screen.\n\n3. SECTION LINKS - You know that bare act for one \nsubject has mentions about sections of other bare \nacts. I have provided direct links for all these \nsections. \nFor Example- \nSection 174A of IPC, has a mention of Section 82 of \nCrPC. \n\nNow many students while reading this section will \nnot know what Section 82 of CrPC is. It will take time \nto find that section in a different bare act.  \nTyping and searching will disturb the flow. \nWhat I have done is that I have given links for these \nsections right there. Clicking on it will instantly take \nyou to those sections in your browser. \n4. BEAUTIFUL - The number points have been made \nbold to look good and help you differentiate different \npoints.",
